# Student Performance Analysis

This project aims to analyze students' grades and identify patterns and relationships between categorical variables that may influence students' performance. Based on these analyses, we intend to propose strategies to improve the grades of students with poorer performance.

## Objectives

- Explore and understand the relationships between students' grades and categorical variables in the dataset.
- Identify which categorical variable has the most influence on students' performance.
- Clusterize students' data to identify groups with similar performance.
- Propose strategies to improve the grades of students in clusters with poor performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about students' grades and various categorical variables such as gender, test preparation, race/ethnicity, among others.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - We explored the relationships between variables in the dataset, using graphs and descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.

2. **Statistical Tests**:
   - We conducted statistical tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis test, to determine which categorical variable has the most influence on students' grades.

3. **Clustering**:
   - We used the K-means algorithm to cluster students' data into groups with similar performance.

4. **Proposed Strategies**:
   - Based on the analysis results, we proposed strategies to improve the grades of students in clusters with poor performance.

## Results

- We identified that the 'lunch' variable has the greatest influence on students' grades, followed by the 'test preparation course' variable.
- We clustered students' data into four groups and identified that Cluster 1 has the poorest performance.
- We proposed strategies to improve the grades of students in Cluster 1, including test preparation course and a better lunch.

## Next Steps

- Implement the proposed strategies to improve the grades of students in clusters with poor performance.
- Evaluate the impact of the implemented strategies and adjust as necessary.
